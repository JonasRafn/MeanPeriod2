Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second
semester?

On 2nd semester we used a technology called .jsp, which relies on java servlets to present the content
of a website. Express can do the same thing with a view-engine, here we can use either Jade, EJS or 
Handlebars. Express works a little bit different than .jsp and servlets, express does not compile the 
html that a client request's but acts a little like a SPA using AngularJS and a Rest-API. In express 
we send back the data that is to be shown on the page, but it is rendered client side.
