Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc?

When you test a REST-API you want to isolate your test as much as possible, 
therefore it is a good idea to mock your HTTP request and your database. 
This can be done using a module called Sinon that is used for making stubs.
