Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to
implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server?
Node.JS can fire up child processes when the load gets big, meaning that you have multiple single threaded
tasks running. Node.JS already comes with this built in the Cluster module, which makes it able to spawn
multiple instances of a Node.JS threads and use a load balancer to ditribute the incoming request to a 
certain Node.JS thread.
Express also runs multiple virtual machines out of the box, so that way there is running multiple 
domains under one ip.
