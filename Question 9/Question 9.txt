Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to
test asynchronous code?

For testing Node.JS and Express you can use a package called mocha, and an assertion package like chai.
This makes it both easy and fast to test your application. To test tasynchronus code, you have to make sure
that you don't test before the callback function has run.
