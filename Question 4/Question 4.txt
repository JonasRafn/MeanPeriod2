Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to the testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript +
relevant packages?

For testing Node.JS and Express you can use a package called mocha, and an assertion package like chai.
This makes it both easy and fast to test your application.
You can then add more packages to test a rest-api, like request or supertest.
