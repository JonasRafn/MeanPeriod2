Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?
We already know javascript, so it would be a great option for the backend. Instead of 
having to learn a new framework and langauge like Drupal. 
Node.JS uses the chrome V8 engine as interpreter, which is super fast. It is also a 
single threaded, non blocking server. Then there is the NPM which is super helpful,
for getting additional "help". The NPM is super smart cause you only have to, tell 
whatever platform you are deploying what packages to install, and not give them like
we did in java.
