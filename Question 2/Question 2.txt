Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using for
example Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat?
Node.JS is a single threaded non blocking server, which makes it super easy to perfom asynchronus calls. 
The genius thing about this is that Node.JS uses an event loop to make asynchronus calls, compared to a 
regular high level language like Java, or C#, which spawns new threads to do this. This makes Node.JS 
very memory efficient, and is also notoriously difficult to program. The data sent between Node.JS and 
and your frontend is already JSON so there is no need to convert it from either JSON to an object in an
high level language, or the other way around.
