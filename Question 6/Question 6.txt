Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions, and the legal implications of doing this?

A session can be a cookie, or other storage on a client machine accseing you website. When using sessions
and cookies you are tracking the clients, this is not legal unless you notify the clients that it is happening.
This can bring you a lot of trouble if you do not take the right precautions, as it can lead huge fines 
for you and the your company.
